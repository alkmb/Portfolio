				<h3>Push_swap (Sorting algorithm)</h3>
				<p>
                    The Push Swap project presents a sorting algorithm to organize
                    numbers in ascending order using two stacks. The challenge lies in the
                    custom implementation of the radix sort algorithm to achieve
                    the desired final order.

                    <h3>Pipex (Implementation of pipes with file descriptors)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Pipex project introduces a shell implementation
                        of pipes that involves two files and two commands. The main goal
                        is to create a pipe between the commands, where the output of the first command
                        serves as input for the second command.

                <h3>Fract-ol (Fractal in graphical interface)</h3>
                <p>
                    The project serves as an introduction to the Xlib library, which provides
                    graphical interfaces in C. The mathematical operations involved in working
                    with real and imaginary numbers to create fractal sets offer
                    an immersive learning experience.

                <h3>Philosophers (Dining Philosophers Problem)</h3>
                <p>
                    The Philosophers project is an implementation of the classic
                    Dining Philosophers Problem. It serves as an introduction to multithreading
                    and mutex optimization, providing a practical scenario to understand
                    and solve synchronization problems in concurrent programming.

                <h3>Minishell (Bash Implementation in C)</h3>
                <p>
                    Minishell is a bash implementation in C.
                    It offers a deep insight into object-oriented programming
                    and PID management. It provides knowledge about how bash works,
                    including file descriptor redirection,
                    pipe implementation, exit status management,
                    and input parsing for different symbols.

			<h3>Cub3d (Wolfenstein copy)</h3>
			<p>
				Cub3D is a project from Ã‰cole 42 that challenges students to recreate a simplified version of the iconic Wolfenstein 3D game, using the principle of raycasting in C. This project not only tests the students' C programming skills but also introduces advanced concepts of computational graphics and game design. A distinctive feature of Cub3D is the ability to create maps both within the code and externally. Users can specify colors and textures for different elements of the map, as well as adjust the size and shape of the map, offering considerable flexibility in customizing the game environment. This project provides a deep hands-on experience in creating a basic game engine and implementing real-time rendering techniques.
